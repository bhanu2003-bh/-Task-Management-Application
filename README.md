    - Each task should have
        - A title (mandatory)

        - Status (mandatory)
            - Automatically fill if card created from buttons in specific section
        - Priority (not mandatory)
            - Values for priority - Low, Medium, Urgent
        - Deadline (not mandatory
    - Users can edit and delete tasks after creation
4. Drag and Drop Functionality:
    - Implement drag and drop feature to move tasks between columns
    - The task's status should update automatically when moved to a different column
